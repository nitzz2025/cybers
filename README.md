# Password Security Analysis - Cybersecurity Internship Task 6

## 📋 Project Overview
This repository contains my analysis of password security as part of my cybersecurity internship. I tested various passwords using online strength checkers and researched common attack methods to understand what makes passwords secure.

## 🎯 Objectives Completed
- ✅ Created 8 passwords with varying complexity levels
- ✅ Tested each password using multiple online strength checkers
- ✅ Researched common password attack methods
- ✅ Analyzed the relationship between password complexity and security
- ✅ Documented best practices for password creation

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- passwordmeter.com
- security.org password checker
- Various cybersecurity research sources
